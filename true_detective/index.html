			<p>In January 2014, Pizzolatto signed a two-year contract extension with HBO, effectively renewing the series for two additional seasons.[35] Much like its predecessor, season two of True Detective consists of eight episodes, all written by Pizzolatto.[15] However, the responsibility of directing was assigned to several people; Justin Lin directed the first two episodes,[36] Fukunaga, who directed all of season one, did not return as director; he remains, however, an executive producer,[37] as do McConaughey and Harrelson. Pizzolatto hired fellow novelist Scott Lasser to help develop and write stories for the second half of the season.[37]</p>
